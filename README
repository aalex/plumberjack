Versioning
==========

This project uses the common "Linux kernel" versioning system, where even-numbered minor versions are stable and
odd-numbered minor versions are development snapshots.

The micro version indicates the origin of the release: even micro numbers are only used for released archives; odd micro
numbers are only used on the Git repository.

A stable series means that the command-line options and the interactive keyboard controls should not change much for all
tags whose version number start with the same major-minor numbers. Some new features might be developped in that branch,
but each release should be backward-compatible with their ancestor. Releases from a stable series should be use for
production. 

In contrast, unstable branches consist of tags which are developer snapshots. They are not expected to be compatible
with any other version. Some features might change between different stable branches.
